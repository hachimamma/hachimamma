# 📘 Multivariable Calculus Toolkit

A powerful collection of tools, notebooks, and symbolic computation modules that bring **multivariable calculus** to life — from gradient fields and Jacobians to surface integrals and vector calculus.

> Built for students, educators, and self-learners who want to **visualize, compute, and understand** higher-dimensional math through code.
